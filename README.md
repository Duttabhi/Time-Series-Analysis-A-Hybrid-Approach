# Time-Series-Analysis-A-Hybrid-Approach

**Abstract** 

Prediction of stock prices has been the primary objective of
an investor. Any future decision taken by the investor directly depends
on the stock prices associated with a company. This work presents a hybrid
approach for the prediction of intra-day stock prices by considering
both time series and sentiment analysis. Furthermore, it focuses on Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for the time series analysis
of stock prices and Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner
(VADER) for sentiment analysis. LSTM is a modified Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) architecture. It is effecient at extracting patterns over sequential
time-series data, where the data spans over long sequences and
also overcomes the gradient vanishing problem of RNN. VADER is a
lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool attuned to sentiments expressed
in social media and news articles. The results of both techniques
are combined to forecast the intra-day stock movement and hence the
model named as LSTM-VDR. The model is first of its kind, a combination
of LSTM and VADER to predict stock prices. The dataset contains
closing prices of the stock and recent news articles combined from various
online sources. This approach, when applied on the stock prices of Bombay
Stock Exchange (BSE) listed companies has shown improvements in
comparison to prior studies.

**Conclusion**


The work demonstrates that the hybrid model that combines financial records
and news articles, can have better performance for certain market conditions.
It, also captures the temporal features satisfactorily even though the model considers
news only from recent days. This results reinforce the fact that the information
of news articles has a short temporal effect for analysis of the stock
market.
